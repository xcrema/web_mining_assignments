Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements Like a thesis statement 
a topic sentence has a specific main point Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay
the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph Like the thesis statement 
a topic sentence has a unifying function But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone 
doesn’t guarantee unity An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis 
whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence 
Note Not all paragraphs need topic sentences In particular opening and closing 
paragraphs which serve different functions from body paragraphs generally don’t have topic sentencessadasd
